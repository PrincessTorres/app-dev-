## Conclusion
Eddie Morra, having risen to extraordinary power and success using the brain-enhancing drug NZT-48, has seemingly overcome its devastating side effects. In the final scenes, Eddie faces Carl Van Loon, a powerful businessman who attempts to control Eddie by threatening to cut off his access to NZT. However, Eddie reveals that he no longer needs the drug. He claims he has developed a way to wean off it while retaining its cognitive benefits permanently. This revelation allows Eddie to maintain his independence and solidify his dominance. The film ends with Eddie running for political office, leaving the audience to ponder his future.
